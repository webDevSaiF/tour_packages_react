# Tour Packages React App

Welcome to the Tour Packages React App repository! This project is designed to help you learn React while building an interactive application that displays tour packages. You'll explore fetching data, managing UI state, and implementing dynamic features to create a comprehensive tour packages experience.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide you with a practical learning experience in React. By working on this project, you'll gain valuable insights into creating dynamic UI components, handling user interactions, and managing data from external sources.

## Features

- **Loading Text Fetch:** The app fetches data and displays a loading message while the data is being fetched.
- **Initial Display:** Upon loading, the app shows five tour packages to the user.
- **Info Text with Read More/Show Less:** Each tour package includes info text that can be expanded to read more or collapsed to show less content.
- **Not Interested Button:** Users can click a "Not Interested" button on each tour package to remove it from the list.
- **Automatic Refresh:** If all packages are removed, a "Refresh" button appears to fetch a new set of tour packages.
- **And Many More:** The app provides an opportunity to implement additional features to enhance the user experience.
